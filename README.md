# What I learned 

I was able to gain a better understanding of the syntax and bracket placement. Up until now I have been struggling with understanding where things were placed within functions. This can be traced back to the fact that I was intimidated by the complexety of it all. However, this time around I was able to put my fears aside and create functions and prompts on my own without copying and pasting previous examples and filling in the needed data for the required assignment. Creating everything from scratch has given me more confidence in understanding where all the brackets go and how they work with relation to function. Allowing me a better understanding where other information can be added or nested. For me personally, this is a huge step in understanding the language.
